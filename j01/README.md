A few years ago when I was much more interested in video games on the computer Valve the company which owns one of the largest digital video game distribution stores started selling a controller for your computer. Swept up in the marketing and needing a controller for playing games in a more relaxed position I purchased one.

When the controller first arrived I discovered the most satisfying feature of this product. The way you put batteries in this controller makes it almost worth using. First I removed the back cover which has this sliding springy latch at the back which makes a satisfying pop up when the back panel is released.

Behind the panel is a lot of information which can be a bit overwhelming at first but after a quick scan, I find two images of batteries with arrows next to them sitting next to the grips of the controller.

This is excellent **mapping** of how to insert the battery the proper way without needing to wonder if I’ve put it in the wrong way or not as well as gives me a hint where to look for the battery spot. Or at least it would be if when you pushed down on the battery it pushed into place or did something. My **mental model** was that I push down on the battery and it would be in its proper place ready for use. This didn’t match the **conceptual model** of how the controller actually works.

After a short amount of moving it around, I notice the only real place I can move it is left and right, so exploring I push a bit on the left which provides a decent amount of resistance, but a little plastic piece gives visual feedback telling me I’m making progress.

Pushing harder leads me to a very satisfying snap into place and that plastic piece fully popping out.

Now that the battery is set into place and everything is complete I noticed that the odd arrow pointing away from the battery diagram now is pointing at the plastic piece that pushed out as I pushed the battery in.

I was curious and thoroughly enjoying every pop and snap that this controller made as I was just putting batteries in, so I decided to push the button.

The Battery pops out making extraction so easy I didn’t even need to touch the battery.

After I finished playing around with that I put the back plate back on to a very satisfying snap. My controller was ready to use and I was already enjoying myself before starting up any game.
