Hello, my name is Peter Menzies I'm planning on eventually being a software engineer. I've been taking classes for far too long and I'm excited to be done soon. My main focus of life right now is growing in relationship with my friends and family. I took this class once before and now I'm looking forward to getting a full understanding of this class because I used a small piece of it in one of my internships.
